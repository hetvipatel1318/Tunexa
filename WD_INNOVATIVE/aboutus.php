Music is basically an art form that soothes and calms human brain 
and body.Taking these two aspects and blending them together tunexa <br>deals with detecting emotion of an individual through expression <br>and playing music according to the mood detected that will alleviate
the mood or simply calm the individual and can also get quicker 
song according to the mood, saving time from looking up different <br>songs.By developing Tunexa, we could assist a user to make all the <br>decision regarding which music one should listen to helping the 
user to reduce his/her stress levels. The user would not have to <br>waste any time in searching or to look up for songs and the best <br>track matching the mood of users,and songs would be shown to the 
user according to his/her mood. 
Thankyou :)
